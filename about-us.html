        <h2 class="h2">My Journey to Becoming a PR holder</h2>
        <p class="indent">Getting PR in Canada has been an incredible ride. From my Student Visa to Work Permit!" working day and night, every step has been a lesson in perseverance and growth.</p>
        <p class="indent">One of the most fascinating aspects has been learning how different people and culture taught you togetherness and life experiences. I've explored different communities like French, Italian, Indian and many more communities.</p>
        <p class="indent">But the real magic lies when you start accepting all the challanges without your parents, all on your own. The satisfaction of seeing growing at workplace and achieving so many awards is incredible.</p>
